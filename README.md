# Email-Spam-Detection
Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning algorithms

This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). The goal is to create an efficient system that enhances email security by filtering out unsolicited spam emails. It leverages various tools, techniques, and machine learning models for accurate detection.

Institution: Galgotias University, Greater Noida
Submission Date: April 2024

Problem Statement
The continuous evolution of spamming techniques makes it difficult for traditional filters to keep up. The aim of this project is to develop a robust machine learning-based system capable of accurately classifying emails as spam or legitimate, thus improving user experience and security in email communication.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
NLTK / spaCy (for Natural Language Processing tasks like tokenization and text processing)
TensorFlow (for deep learning model implementation, if applicable)
Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)
Datasets: Enron, TREC, and public email corpora

Algorithms Used:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Neural Networks (optional)

Features
Email Content Analysis: The system analyzes email content to extract features like word frequency, presence of keywords, and metadata such as sender information.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Multiple machine learning algorithms are used to classify emails.
Real-Time Email Classification: The trained model can be deployed to classify incoming emails in real-time.
Project Workflow

Data Collection:
Gather email data containing both spam and legitimate (ham) emails.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the email dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Perform tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare the text for analysis

Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from email content, such as word frequency, sender reputation, and header analysis.
Techniques like information gain and chi-square tests are used to select the most important features.

Model Training:
Use machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest to train the model.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for real-time email classification.
Monitor performance and continuously update the model to adapt to evolving spam patterns.

Performance Metrics
Accuracy: 96.5%
Precision: 97.2%
Recall: 94.8%
F1-Score: 95.9%
ROC-AUC: 0.98

Future Scope
Improved Feature Engineering: Utilize advanced feature extraction techniques like semantic analysis and context-aware features.
Ensemble Learning: Combine multiple models for better performance.
Real-Time Adaptation: Implement mechanisms for real-time updates to the model based on new spam patterns.
User Behavior Analysis: Integrate user feedback to enhance model personalization.
